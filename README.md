Secret Blocks is a simple mod that allows players to add hidden/secret blocks to the world.  These blocks include various 
Redstone components, such as Secret Redstone Wire, Secret Buttons, Secret Levers, Secret Pressure Plates, Secret Doors, Secret Trapdoors 
and more.  In addition to the secret Redstone components, Secret Blocks also adds Secret Chests, Secret Dispensers, Secret Hoppers, 
Secret Stairs, Ghost Blocks and One-Way Glass. All of these blocks can be crafted using the their vanilla counterparts and a Secret Dummy Block.

This mod was developed with heavy inspiration from the original Secret Rooms Mod, but was created for Fabric.  The mod is currently in development, and 
will be updated with new features and bug fixes as time goes on.
